The files in this directory are the Maraston 2005 SSP downloaded from
http://www.icg.port.ac.uk/~maraston/Claudia%27s_Stellar_Population_Model.html
on August 2013.

We are only using the horizontal branch red morphology (rhb files) and are not
using the extrem metallicities (1/200 Zsun and 3.5 Zsun) because their age
grid is different.
