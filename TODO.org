* Tasks
** TODO Check the age of the Universe at observation redshift.
In the psum module, when dealing with an observation, only use the models aged
less than the age of the Universe at observation redshift.
** TODO Deal with observation without values in some filters.
** TODO SED serialisation.
Code SED serialisation to store them in a database without pickling the whole
object.
** TODO Enhance the management of array parameters.
When a parameter is an array (like the filters for which the attenuation is
computed in the attenuation modules) the user must use the "eval ..."
notation. Try to find a better notation. Implement the generation for default
parameters. Maybe use tuples instead of arrays.
** DONE Homogenise the metallicity numbering.                    .
CLOSED: [2013-07-09 mar. 11:25]
Use the one for which the "solar" metallicity is 0.02.
** TODO Code the creation of mock catalogues.
** TODO Create some plot to check the fit quality:
  - plot giving for each band the ratio between the observed flux and the best
    sed flux.
  - colour plots (colours chosen by the user) comparing the colour ranges
    covered by the simulation and the colours of the observed galaxies.)
** TODO Write documentation.
** TODO Code IGM effect module.
Make the IGM module only add the IGM effect and use the SED redshifting
method.
** TODO Make the IGM module work with a list (or range) of redshift.
This will allow the use of pcigale to compute photometric redshifts.
** TODO Enhance the interpolation method.
Work on interpolation method to try to avoir the "wave effect" when plotting
in logarithmic scale.
** TODO Change attenuations computed by attenuation modules.
Compute both continuum and total attenuation in the filters in the attenuation
modules.
** TODO Deal with lines in the same way as continuum contributions.
Transform the way lines are stored to be more coherent with the way the
continuum is dealt with. Maybe something like line_wavelength (1D array),
line_width (nD array) and line_fluxes (nD array).
** TODO Best SED table output for psum module
The psum module should also produce a table containing, for analysed source,
the flux, parameters and χ² of the best fitting SED.
** TODO In the filter integration swith to flux before integration.
