* Check the age of the Universe at observation redshift.
* Deal with observation without values in some filters.
* Code ISM effect module.
* Code AGN module.
* Make the ISM effect a module separated from the main SED creation modules
  and applied according to the redshift of the observation.
* Make the ISM module work with a list (or range) of redshift to allow the
  use of pcigale to compute photometric redshifts.
* Code the theoretical SED serialisation and the database to store them.
* Write documentation.
* When a default parameter is an array, use the "eval ..." the the generated
  ini file.
* Change metallicity numbering (ex. 0.02 for solar).
