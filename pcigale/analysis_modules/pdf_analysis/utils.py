def gen_pdf(values, probabilities, grid):
    """Generate a probability density function

    For a list of values and associated probabilities, this function
    generates a probability density using a weighted gaussian kernel
    density estimation.

    This part should definitely be improved as it is done in the simplest
    way: each value is repeated (probability * 100) times and the standard
    scipy gaussian KDE is used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    values : array like of floats
        The values of the variable.
    probabilities : array like of floats
        The probability associated with each value
    grid : array like of float
        The list of values to which the probability will be evaluated.

    Returns
    -------
    The list of probabilities evaluated at each value of the grid. If there
    is only one input value with a probability superior to 0, the scipy KDE
    algorithm will fail and None is returned.
