For now, the SED does not "know" its redshift (whether it was redshifted or
not) and the redshift is given in parameter to the compute_fnu method. This
makes thing uneasy for analysis modules like savefluxes if one wants to compute
fluxes at various redshit because we had to hard code the redshift at which the
flux is computed.
* Make the redshift a SED attribute.
* Make the compute_fnu use this redshift.
* Change the analysis modules accordingly.
