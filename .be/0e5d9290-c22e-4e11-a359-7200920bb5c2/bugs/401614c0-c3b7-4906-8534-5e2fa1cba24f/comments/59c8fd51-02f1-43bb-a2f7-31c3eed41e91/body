The pcigale database containing the models and the filters should be moved
to the user home directory.

Advantages of having a system-wide database:
* As it is quite large, if several users use pcigale on the same database, there
  will be only one database.
* It make easier to install pcigale using a package.
* The database will be installed at the same time of pcigale and will always be
  up to date.

Advantages of having the database in user's home:
* We can develop tools allowing user to easily add new filters.
* pcigale package becomes lighter.
